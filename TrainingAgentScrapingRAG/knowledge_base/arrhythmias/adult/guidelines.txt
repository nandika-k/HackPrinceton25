## Overview

Heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias) are when your heart beats too quickly or too slowly, or your heartbeat is not steady. It might not be serious but see a GP if you think you're having symptoms. Arrhythmias happen when there's a fault with the electrical system that makes your heart beat.

There are different types of heart rhythm problem. You may have a fast heartbeat (tachycardia), a slow heartbeat (bradycardia) or an irregular heartbeat where the rhythm changes.

## Symptoms of Heart Rhythm Problems

This can make you feel:

- **Like your heart is pounding, racing, fluttering or missing a beat (heart palpitations)** – this may last for a few seconds up to a few minutes
- **Short of breath**
- **Lightheaded, dizzy or like you might faint**
- **Tired**
- **Chest pain or discomfort**

Having these symptoms does not necessarily mean you have a heart rhythm problem.

### Tachycardia (Fast Heart Rate)

Tachycardia refers to a heart rate that's too fast. Details about symptoms and risks of fast heart rhythms include:

- Rapid heartbeat that may feel like a pounding or racing sensation
- May cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting
- Can lead to reduced blood flow to vital organs
- May increase the risk of stroke or heart failure in some cases

## When to Seek Medical Advice

### Non-urgent advice: See a GP if:

- You think you may have heart rhythm problems
- You have heart palpitations that keep happening or are getting worse

### Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if:

You currently have heart palpitations with any of these symptoms:

- **Chest pain**
- **Shortness of breath**
- **Feeling dizzy or lightheaded**
- **Fainting or feeling like you might faint**

**Information:** If you've had these symptoms but they've now stopped, ask your GP surgery for an urgent appointment, call 111 or get help from 111 online.

**Information:** Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you.

## First Aid Steps

### If Someone Is Experiencing Heart Rhythm Problems:

1. **Stay Calm and Reassure the Person**
   - Help them sit or lie down in a comfortable position
   - Stay calm yourself to help reduce their anxiety

2. **Assess the Situation**
   - Check if they are conscious and responsive
   - Monitor their breathing
   - Note any other symptoms (chest pain, dizziness, etc.)

3. **Call for Emergency Help if Needed**
   - If they have chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting along with palpitations, call 999 immediately
   - Do not delay calling emergency services if symptoms are severe

4. **Provide Comfort**
   - Loosen any tight clothing
   - Help them rest in a comfortable position
   - Keep them calm and reassured

5. **Monitor the Person**
   - Watch for changes in their condition
   - Be prepared to start CPR if they become unresponsive and stop breathing
   - Stay with them until emergency services arrive

6. **Do Not Give Medication**
   - Do not give any medication unless prescribed for this condition
   - Do not give aspirin or other medications without medical guidance

## Causes of Heart Rhythm Problems

Heart rhythm problems happen when there's a fault with the electrical system that makes your heart beat. This can be the result of:

### Heart Rhythm Conditions:
- Atrial fibrillation
- Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)

### Other Conditions That Can Cause Heart Rhythm Problems:
- High blood pressure
- Coronary heart disease
- Heart valve disease

## Treatment for Heart Rhythm Problems

How a heart rhythm problem is treated depends on the type you have and what's causing it. Many people may not need any treatment at all or will only need regular check-ups.

Possible treatments include:

- **Medicine to control the rate and rhythm of your heartbeat**, such as beta blockers
- **Burning or freezing the section of heart that's causing your faulty heart rhythm** (ablation)
- **Using electrical signals to reset your heart rhythm** (cardioversion)
- **Having a small electronic device that helps monitor and correct your heart rhythm fitted under your skin** (pacemaker implantation)

You may also need treatment for any condition that's causing your heart rhythm problems.

## Important Notes

- Not all heart rhythm problems are serious, but they should be evaluated by a healthcare professional
- Some arrhythmias can be harmless, while others may require immediate medical attention
- Fast heart rhythms (tachycardia) can increase the risk of complications in some cases
- Always seek medical advice if you experience persistent or worsening symptoms
- Do not ignore symptoms, especially if they are accompanied by chest pain, shortness of breath, or fainting
- Call 999 immediately if symptoms are severe or life-threatening
