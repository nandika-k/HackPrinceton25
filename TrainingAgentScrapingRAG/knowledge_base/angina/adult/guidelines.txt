## Overview

Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when the heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. It's usually a symptom of coronary heart disease. An angina attack is not a heart attack, but it can be a warning sign that a heart attack is more likely to happen in the future.

Angina is different from a heart attack. During an angina attack, the heart is still working, but it's not getting enough blood. During a heart attack, the blood supply to part of the heart is completely blocked, causing damage to the heart muscle.

## Symptoms of Angina

Angina typically causes:

- **Chest pain or discomfort** – often described as pressure, squeezing, tightness, or heaviness in the chest
- **Pain that may spread** – to the neck, jaw, shoulders, arms (especially the left arm), back, or stomach
- **Shortness of breath**
- **Feeling sick (nausea)**
- **Feeling tired**
- **Dizziness**
- **Sweating**

The pain or discomfort usually comes on during physical activity or emotional stress and goes away with rest or medication. However, some people may experience angina even at rest (unstable angina), which is more serious.

## First Aid Steps for an Angina Attack

### Step 1: Stop Activity and Rest

- **Stop what you're doing immediately** – do not continue with any activity
- **Sit down and rest** – help the person sit in a comfortable position, ideally with their back supported
- **Stay calm** – anxiety can make symptoms worse

### Step 2: Take Prescribed Medication

- **If the person has been prescribed medication for angina** (such as glyceryl trinitrate, GTN, or nitroglycerin):
  - Help them take their medication as prescribed
  - Medication is usually taken as a spray under the tongue or as a tablet
  - The medication should start to work within a few minutes

### Step 3: Monitor the Situation

- **Wait for the medication to work** – symptoms should improve within a few minutes
- **Stay with the person** – do not leave them alone
- **Monitor their condition** – watch for any changes

### Step 4: If Symptoms Persist or Worsen

- **If symptoms do not improve after taking medication**, or if they get worse:
  - **Call 999 immediately** – this could indicate a heart attack
  - Do not delay – seek emergency medical help right away
- **If this is the first time the person has experienced these symptoms**:
  - **Call 999 immediately** – they need to be assessed by a healthcare professional

## When to Call Emergency Services

### Call 999 immediately if:

- The person's chest pain is severe and doesn't go away after resting and taking their medication
- The pain lasts longer than a few minutes
- The pain spreads to other areas (neck, jaw, arms, back, or stomach)
- The person feels sick, sweaty, breathless, or lightheaded
- This is the first time the person has experienced these symptoms
- The person has taken their prescribed medication (such as GTN) and the symptoms have not improved after 5 minutes
- The person needs to take a second dose of their medication

### Important Information:

- **Do not drive to the hospital** – call 999 and wait for an ambulance
- **Bring any medicines** the person takes with you to the hospital
- **Stay with the person** until emergency services arrive

## What Not to Do

- **Do not** ignore the symptoms or try to "walk it off"
- **Do not** give the person any medication unless it has been prescribed for angina
- **Do not** give aspirin unless advised by a healthcare professional (unless it's part of their prescribed treatment)
- **Do not** leave the person alone
- **Do not** delay calling for emergency help if symptoms are severe or persistent

## Managing Angina Attacks

### If Someone Has Angina:

1. **Know their medication** – if you're caring for someone with angina, make sure you know:
   - What medication they take
   - How and when to administer it
   - Where they keep it

2. **Help them rest** – during an attack, help them sit down and rest

3. **Administer medication** – help them take their prescribed medication if needed

4. **Monitor the situation** – watch for any changes in their condition

5. **Call for help if needed** – if symptoms don't improve or get worse, call 999

### Prevention:

- **Take medication as prescribed** – if the person has been prescribed medication to prevent angina attacks
- **Avoid triggers** – help identify and avoid things that trigger angina (such as physical exertion, emotional stress, cold weather, large meals)
- **Follow medical advice** – ensure the person follows their healthcare provider's advice about managing their condition

## Important Distinctions

### Angina vs. Heart Attack

- **Angina:** Chest pain that usually comes on during activity and goes away with rest or medication. The heart is still working but not getting enough blood.
- **Heart Attack:** Chest pain that is usually more severe, lasts longer, and doesn't go away with rest or medication. The blood supply to part of the heart is completely blocked.

If you're unsure whether it's angina or a heart attack, always treat it as a heart attack and call 999 immediately.

## Important Notes

- Angina is a warning sign of coronary heart disease
- An angina attack is not a heart attack, but it can be a warning that a heart attack is more likely
- Always take angina symptoms seriously
- If someone has been diagnosed with angina, they should carry their medication with them at all times
- If symptoms don't improve with medication or rest, or if this is the first episode, call 999 immediately
- Do not delay seeking medical help if symptoms are severe or persistent
