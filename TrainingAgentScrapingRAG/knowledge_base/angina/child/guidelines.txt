## Overview

Angina in children is extremely rare. Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when the heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. It's usually a symptom of coronary heart disease, which is uncommon in children.

In children, chest pain is more commonly caused by other conditions such as:
- Musculoskeletal pain (muscle strain, injury)
- Respiratory conditions (asthma, pneumonia)
- Gastrointestinal issues (acid reflux, stomach problems)
- Anxiety or stress
- Less commonly, heart-related issues

However, **any chest pain or cardiac symptoms in a child should be evaluated by a medical professional immediately**, especially if accompanied by other concerning symptoms.

## Symptoms of Angina in Children

If a child were to experience angina (which is very rare), symptoms might include:

- **Chest pain or discomfort** – the child may complain of chest pain, pressure, or tightness
- **Pain that may spread** – to the neck, jaw, shoulders, or arms
- **Shortness of breath** – difficulty breathing or rapid breathing
- **Feeling sick (nausea)**
- **Feeling tired or weak**
- **Dizziness**
- **Sweating** – cold, clammy skin
- **Pale skin**
- **Irritability or restlessness**

Children may not be able to clearly describe what they're feeling, so it's important to observe their behavior and physical signs.

## First Aid Steps

### Step 1: Stop Activity and Rest

- **Stop any activity immediately** – have the child stop what they're doing
- **Sit or lie down** – help the child sit or lie in a comfortable position
- **Stay calm** – your calmness will help the child stay calm
- **Reassure the child** – let them know help is on the way

### Step 2: Call for Emergency Help

- **Call 999 immediately** – any chest pain in a child should be evaluated by a healthcare professional immediately
- **Do not delay** – even if you're unsure whether it's angina or something else, seek emergency medical help
- **Stay on the phone** – follow the dispatcher's instructions

### Step 3: Monitor the Child

- **Stay with the child** – do not leave them alone
- **Monitor their breathing** – watch for any changes
- **Check their responsiveness** – make sure they remain conscious and responsive
- **Watch for changes** – note any changes in their condition

### Step 4: Provide Comfort

- **Loosen tight clothing** – help them breathe more easily
- **Keep them calm** – reassure them that help is on the way
- **Stay calm yourself** – your calmness is important

### Important: Do Not Give Medication

- **Do NOT give any medication** unless specifically instructed by emergency medical services or a healthcare provider
- **Do NOT give aspirin** to children without medical guidance
- **Do NOT give nitroglycerin or other angina medications** unless the child has been specifically diagnosed with angina and has a prescription

## When to Call Emergency Services

### Call 999 immediately if:

- A child is experiencing chest pain or discomfort
- The chest pain is accompanied by:
  - Shortness of breath
  - Dizziness or fainting
  - Nausea or vomiting
  - Sweating
  - Pale or bluish skin
  - Unusual fatigue or weakness
  - Loss of consciousness
- The child has a known heart condition and is experiencing symptoms
- You're concerned about the child's condition for any reason

### Important Information:

- **Do not drive to the hospital** – call 999 and wait for an ambulance
- **Bring any medicines** the child takes with you to the hospital
- **Stay with the child** until emergency services arrive
- **Trust your instincts** – if something seems seriously wrong, seek immediate help

## What Not to Do

- **Do not** ignore chest pain in a child
- **Do not** assume it's nothing serious – always seek medical attention
- **Do not** give any medication without medical guidance
- **Do not** give aspirin to children without explicit medical instructions
- **Do not** leave the child alone
- **Do not** delay calling for emergency help

## Special Considerations for Children

1. **Communication:** Children may have difficulty describing symptoms – trust observable signs and behavior changes
2. **Anxiety:** Children may be frightened – staying calm and reassuring is crucial
3. **Underlying Conditions:** Children with known heart conditions should have an emergency action plan from their healthcare provider
4. **Rarity:** Angina in children is extremely rare – chest pain is more likely caused by other conditions, but should still be evaluated immediately
5. **Medical Evaluation:** Any chest pain in a child requires immediate medical evaluation to determine the cause

## Important Notes

- Angina in children is extremely rare and is typically associated with underlying heart conditions
- Any chest pain in a child should be taken seriously and evaluated immediately by a healthcare professional
- Do not give any medication to children without medical guidance
- Always call 999 if a child is experiencing chest pain, especially if accompanied by other symptoms
- Trust your instincts – if something seems seriously wrong, seek immediate help
- Children with known heart conditions should have an emergency action plan from their healthcare provider
