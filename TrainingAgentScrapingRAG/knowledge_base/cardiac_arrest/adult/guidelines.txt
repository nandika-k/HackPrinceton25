## Call Emergency Medical Services (EMS)

Upon identifying the symptoms of cardiac arrest, your next vital action should be to immediately seek professional aid. If you encounter someone unconscious and not breathing or observe someone suddenly fainting, promptly dial 911 or your local emergency number. This step is vital as it sets the emergency response system in motion, ensuring trained professionals and sophisticated medical equipment reach the scene as quickly as possible.

When making the emergency call, it's important to:

1. Stay calm
2. Provide clear, concise information to the dispatcher
3. Clearly state the address or location of the emergency
4. Provide details about what is happening. For example, you might say, "A woman is in cardiac arrest in our office."
5. Be prepared to describe the condition of the person, including whether they are breathing, conscious, and if there's any visible bleeding.

This information helps the emergency responders prepare appropriately and arrive ready to provide immediate treatment, ensuring immediate care.

If you're alone with the person in cardiac arrest, follow these steps:

1. Put your phone on speaker mode while you perform CPR. This allows you to start life-saving measures immediately while staying in communication with the emergency dispatcher.
2. The dispatcher may provide you with instructions on how to perform CPR or use an AED if one is available.
3. Remember, every second counts in cardiac arrest, so calling for professional help and starting CPR as soon as possible are crucial steps in improving the person's chances of survival.

## Perform Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)

Following the emergency medical services alert, the subsequent essential action is to initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). CPR, a lifesaving method, can multiply a person's survival odds during cardiac arrest by two or even three times. It functions by manually circulating blood to vital organs, especially the brain and heart, once the heart ceases to beat effectively.

To start CPR, follow these steps:

1. Place the person on their back on a firm, flat surface.
2. If you're trained in CPR, you'll perform a combination of chest compressions and rescue breaths.
3. However, if you're untrained or not confident in your ability to perform rescue breaths, it's acceptable to do hands-only CPR.
4. Hands-only CPR involves uninterrupted chest compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 per minute.

Remember, any CPR is better than no CPR. Even if you're not formally trained, don't be afraid to act. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Push hard and fast on the center of the chest, allowing the chest to fully recoil between compressions.
2. Continue performing CPR until an AED is accessible.
3. If emergency workers arrive, hand over the situation to them.

### Chest Compressions

Chest compressions are the cornerstone of effective CPR. To perform them correctly, follow these steps:

1. Position your hands in the center of the person's chest, right between the nipples.
2. Use both hands, one on top of the other, with your fingers interlaced.
3. Push hard and fast, using your body weight to help you apply pressure.
4. The goal is to compress the chest at least 2 inches deep, but no more than 2.4 inches. This depth ensures that you're effectively pumping blood through the body.
5. Maintain a rate of 100 to 120 compressions per minute.
6. Allow the chest to fully recoil between compressions to allow the heart to refill with blood.
7. Minimize interruptions – try to keep chest compressions going as continuously as possible.

### Rescue Breaths (If Trained)

If you're trained in CPR and comfortable performing rescue breaths:

1. After 30 chest compressions, open the airway by tilting the head back and lifting the chin.
2. Pinch the nose closed.
3. Give two rescue breaths, each lasting about one second, watching for the chest to rise.
4. Return immediately to chest compressions.
5. Continue the cycle of 30 compressions followed by 2 breaths.

If you're not trained or not comfortable with rescue breaths, continue with hands-only CPR (chest compressions only).

## Use an Automated External Defibrillator (AED)

If an AED is available, use it as soon as possible. These devices can analyze the heart's rhythm and deliver a shock if necessary, potentially restarting the heart's normal electrical activity. Using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) as soon as possible can significantly increase the chances of restarting the heart's normal rhythm during cardiac arrest.

When using an AED:

1. Turn on the AED and follow the voice prompts.
2. Apply the pads to the person's bare chest as directed by the AED (usually one pad on the upper right chest and one on the lower left side).
3. Stand clear during analysis – do not touch the person while the AED is analyzing the heart rhythm.
4. If a shock is advised, ensure everyone is clear and press the shock button when prompted.
5. After the shock, immediately resume CPR.
6. Continue following the AED prompts, which will guide you through additional shocks (if needed) or continuing hands-only CPR. Remember, early CPR and defibrillation significantly increase the likelihood of survival without brain damage.

### Special Considerations When Using an AED

- It is safe to use an AED on someone with a pacemaker as long as the pads are placed at least one inch away from the pacemaker site.
- Avoid using an AED on a wet surface, as water conducts electricity and can pose a danger to the rescuer and the patient.

## Continue Care Until Help Arrives

Performing CPR can be physically demanding, and fatigue can set in quickly. If another trained person is present, it's beneficial to switch roles every two minutes to maintain the quality and effectiveness of the compressions. While waiting for EMS, stay attentive to any instructions the emergency dispatcher may provide over the phone. They might guide you through additional first aid measures or adjustments to your technique. Your continuous efforts during this time are critical, as immediate and uninterrupted cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation are the main interventions that have been shown to improve patient outcomes in cardiac arrest.

Continue performing CPR until:
- Emergency medical services arrive and take over
- The person shows signs of life (breathing, movement, response)
- An AED is analyzing or delivering a shock
- You are too exhausted to continue safely
- The scene becomes unsafe

## Important Notes

- Do not delay CPR while waiting for an AED.
- Push hard enough – at least 2 inches deep for adults (but no more than 2.4 inches).
- Minimize interruptions in chest compressions.
- Every minute without intervention decreases survival odds by approximately 10%.
- Any CPR is better than no CPR – don't hesitate to act even if you're not formally trained.
- Early recognition and immediate action are crucial for survival.
