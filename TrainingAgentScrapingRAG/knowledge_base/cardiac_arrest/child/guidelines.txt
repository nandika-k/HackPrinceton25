# Cardiac Arrest - Child First Aid Guidelines

## Overview
Cardiac arrest in children is often caused by respiratory failure. Immediate CPR is crucial.

## Steps to Follow

1. **Check Responsiveness**
   - Tap the child's shoulder and call their name
   - Check for breathing (look, listen, feel)

2. **Call for Help**
   - Call emergency services immediately (911 in US)
   - If alone with a child, perform 2 minutes of CPR before calling (if child is unresponsive)

3. **Start CPR**
   - Use one or two hands depending on child's size
   - For small children: use one hand or two fingers for infants
   - Push hard and fast (100-120 compressions per minute)
   - Compression depth: about 1/3 of chest depth (about 2 inches for children, 1.5 inches for infants)

4. **Rescue Breaths**
   - After 30 compressions, give 2 rescue breaths
   - Tilt head back, lift chin
   - Give breath over 1 second, watching chest rise

5. **Continue Until Help Arrives**
   - Continue cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths
   - Continue until emergency responders arrive or child shows signs of life

## Important Notes
- For infants, use two fingers or thumbs for compressions
- Compressions should be gentler but still effective
- Rescue breathing is critical for children (as opposed to compression-only for adults)
- Continue until emergency responders take over

## When to Stop
- Emergency responders take over
- Child shows signs of life (breathing, movement, response)
- You are too exhausted to continue safely
- Scene becomes unsafe
