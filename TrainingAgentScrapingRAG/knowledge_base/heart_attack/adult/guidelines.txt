## Overview

A heart attack occurs when blood supply to part of the heart muscle is blocked, leading to damage. During a heart attack, your heart continues to pump, albeit at a reduced rate. People are typically alert and responsive during a heart attack. This is different from cardiac arrest, where the heart stops beating completely.

"If you feel like something's not right, start by seeking immediate medical care," says cardiologist Jacqueline Tamis-Holland, MD. "Every minute matters when it comes to limiting damage to the heart."

The faster you act on a heart attack, the better your chances of preventing long-term heart damage. Don't wave off signs of a heart attack as nothing to worry about. While a heart attack is a serious situation, the survival and recovery rates are extremely high with medical treatment that quickly restores blood flow to the affected area of your heart.

## Key Takeaways

- Calling 911 or emergency services should always be your first step.
- Every minute matters when it comes to limiting damage to the heart.
- Heart attack symptoms can vary from person to person and can be different in women than they are in men.
- The trick to surviving a heart attack is to get immediate care so we can open the blocked artery and restore blood flow to the heart.

## Recognize the Signs of a Heart Attack

Signs and symptoms of a heart attack vary from person to person and can be different in women than they are in men. Even people who have had a heart attack before may not experience the same signs and symptoms if they have a second heart attack. The signs and symptoms of a heart attack may also be more subtle in people with certain medical conditions, such as diabetes. If you suspect a heart attack, always respond as if it is one.

### Common Symptoms

The message from your heart could be delivered by:

- **Pressure or tightness in your chest** - Persistent chest pain or discomfort lasting more than 3 to 5 minutes
- **Pain in your left side** - Pain that spreads to the shoulder, arm, jaw, or neck, or back
- **Heartburn-like discomfort**
- **Cold sweats**
- **Shortness of breath**
- **A sense of "impending doom"**
- **Pale, ashen, or bluish skin**, especially around the face
- **Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or light-headedness**
- **Unexplained fatigue or malaise**

### Symptoms in Women

Although men often have the "classic" signs and symptoms of a heart attack, such as chest pain that radiates down one arm, women often have more subtle signs and symptoms or experience the signs and symptoms of a heart attack differently than men do. For example, in women, the "classic" signs and symptoms may be milder or accompanied by more general signs and symptoms such as:

- Shortness of breath
- Nausea or vomiting
- Extreme fatigue
- Dizziness or light-headedness
- Back or jaw pain

### Important Timing Information

Heart attack symptoms typically linger, so if the above issues continue for 10 minutes (or more), it's important to seek emergency care. Permanent heart damage may occur if blood flow is restricted for 30 minutes.

## First Aid for a Heart Attack

### Step 1: Call 911 Immediately

If someone is showing signs of a heart attack, the first and most important step is to call 911 for emergency care. This step is vital as it sets the emergency response system in motion, ensuring trained professionals and sophisticated medical equipment reach the scene as quickly as possible.

If you're with someone who may be having a heart attack, stay with them after calling 911 or emergency services and follow instructions from the emergency dispatcher. If you're alone and potentially having a heart attack, stay on the phone with your emergency dispatcher.

**DO NOT get impatient and try to drive yourself to the hospital or ER.** A heart attack can take a life-threatening turn on the way to the hospital, which is not when you want to be driving or even riding along. If things escalate in the ambulance, on the other hand, treatment can begin immediately.

### Step 2: Immediate Actions While Waiting for Help

Until the rescue vehicle sirens reach your location, you may be advised to:

#### Take Aspirin
Aspirin is a blood thinner that can help prevent clotting and maintain blood flow to your heart. Given that, it's often recommended during a heart attack. Your 911 operator can offer guidance on whether to take aspirin.

#### Take Nitroglycerine (If Prescribed)
Nitroglycerine is a medication that relaxes blood vessels to improve blood flow. Tell the emergency operator if you have a prescription for it. They can advise you on whether to take it. If the person has prescribed medication for chest pain, such as nitroglycerin, assist them in taking it if available.

#### Have the Person Rest
Have the person stop any activity and rest in a comfortable position. Sit down and focus on staying calm. "There's no need to be pacing or moving around," says Dr. Tamis-Holland. "A heart attack isn't something you can walk off."

#### Get Comfortable
If your clothes feel tight, loosen your belt or unbutton your shirt. Removing extra layers of clothing (if you're up for it) can help save time for emergency responders if they need to start an IV or do an EKG.

### Step 3: Monitor and Prepare

Monitor the person closely until emergency medical services arrive. Be prepared to perform CPR or use an AED if the person becomes unresponsive.

## Important Distinctions

### Heart Attack vs. Cardiac Arrest

It's important to distinguish and understand the difference between a heart attack and cardiac arrest:

- **Heart Attack:** During a heart attack, your heart continues to pump, albeit at a reduced rate. People are typically alert and responsive during a heart attack.
- **Cardiac Arrest:** A cardiac arrest is when your heart stops beating and pumping blood, leading to a complete body shutdown. People typically collapse and are unresponsive. A heart attack can escalate to cardiac arrest, but not always.

### Should You Give CPR for a Heart Attack?

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, is NOT something you do on someone having a heart attack unless their heart attack triggers a cardiac arrest and stops their heart — a much more serious event.

"If someone is unconscious and doesn't have a pulse, that would be the time for CPR," clarifies Dr. Tamis-Holland. "Do not do CPR on an awake person who's talking to you and saying they have chest pain. You could make their situation worse."

### Can an AED Be Used for a Heart Attack?

An AED, or automated external defibrillator, should only be used on someone in cardiac arrest — NOT for a heart attack. The device delivers an electrical charge to "shock" your heart back into its normal rhythm.

"Again, this is where it's important to distinguish and understand the difference between a heart attack and cardiac arrest," states Dr. Tamis-Holland.

## The Importance of Quick Action

Nobody is immune to a heart attack after all, emphasizes Dr. Tamis-Holland. It can happen at any age, too. In fact, research shows an alarming increase in heart attacks for people under the age of 40 in the United States.

"Everybody is at risk," she continues. "So, if you're feeling chest pain and discomfort or other symptoms, listen to your body. Don't ignore your heart telling you something."

"The trick to surviving a heart attack is to get immediate care so we can open the blocked artery and restore blood flow to the heart," explains Dr. Tamis-Holland. "That's why it's so important to be seen as soon as possible."

## Important Notes

- Do not delay calling 911 - every minute matters.
- Do not drive yourself or the person to the hospital - wait for emergency medical services.
- Do not give CPR to someone who is awake and talking - only if they become unconscious and have no pulse.
- Do not use an AED for a heart attack - only for cardiac arrest.
- If you suspect a heart attack, always respond as if it is one, even if symptoms seem mild.
- Heart attack symptoms can be subtle, especially in women and people with diabetes.
- Permanent heart damage may occur if blood flow is restricted for 30 minutes.
